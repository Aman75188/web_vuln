Automated web vulnerability scanner for authorized security testing.

Version Python React FastAPI

Authorized Use Only
SentinalScan is intended only for systems you own or have explicit permission to test. It includes SSRF protections, bounded defaults, authentication, and non-destructive payloads, but operators are still responsible for scope, rate limits, and authorization.

Features
FastAPI backend with authenticated REST endpoints under /api/v1.
Authenticated WebSocket log stream at /ws/logs/{scan_id}.
Async crawler with same-origin scope, exclude paths, stop support, response-size limits, and redirect-aware SSRF checks.
Private/internal RFC1918 targets are blocked by default and require explicit UI opt-in for authorized internal testing.
Scanner plugins for reflected XSS, SQL injection, CSRF, security headers, and sensitive-file exposure.
Live partial findings while a scan is running.
React/Vite dashboard with session API-key entry, scan history, live logs, severity cards, charts, filters, and JSON/CSV export.
Docker Compose setup for the backend and built frontend.

Environment
Real .env files are ignored by git. Copy the examples and fill them locally.

Backend variables use the SENTINAL_ prefix:

cd backend
cp .env.example .env
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
Set at least:

SENTINAL_API_KEY=<64-char-random-hex>
SENTINAL_SECRET_KEY=<separate-64-char-random-hex>
SENTINAL_BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS=["http://localhost:5173","http://localhost:3000","http://127.0.0.1:5173"]
Frontend variables are public after Vite builds the app. Do not treat VITE_API_KEY as a secret. The UI provides a session-only API key field backed by sessionStorage.

cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
Required frontend values:

VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1
VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8000
Docker Setup
Create backend/.env first, then run:

docker compose up --build
Open:

Frontend: http://localhost:5173
Backend health: http://localhost:8000/health
API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
The frontend Docker build receives these build args from docker-compose.yml:

VITE_API_URL: http://localhost:8000/api/v1
VITE_WS_URL: ws://localhost:8000
Because Vite embeds these at build time, rebuild the frontend image after changing them.

Local Backend
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Startup fails if SENTINAL_API_KEY is missing, shorter than 32 characters, or set to a known default such as dev_api_key_12345 or changeme_in_production.

Local Frontend
cd frontend
npm ci
copy .env.example .env
npm run dev
Open http://localhost:5173, paste the backend SENTINAL_API_KEY into the dashboard's Session API Key field, confirm authorization, and start a scan.

For authorized internal testing where DNS resolves to RFC1918 addresses such as 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, or 192.168.0.0/16, expand Advanced Configuration and enable Allow private/internal target. Loopback, link-local, CGNAT, reserved ranges, and cloud metadata-style addresses remain blocked.

Testing
cd backend
python -m compileall -q app
python -m pytest -q

cd ../frontend
npm run lint
npm run build
Live Logs
The frontend connects to:

ws://localhost:8000/ws/logs/{scan_id}?api_key=<SENTINAL_API_KEY>
If the WebSocket cannot stay connected during an active scan, the UI falls back to authenticated REST polling of /api/v1/scan/{scan_id}/logs.

Troubleshooting
API key mismatch: REST returns 401 for missing keys and 403 for wrong keys. Paste the same value as SENTINAL_API_KEY into the frontend Session API Key field.
Backend startup API key entropy error: generate a new key with python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))" and set SENTINAL_API_KEY.
CORS issue: include the frontend origin in SENTINAL_BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS.
Docker frontend calls /scan/ instead of /api/v1/scan/: rebuild after confirming VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1.
WebSocket fails: confirm VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8000 and that the Session API Key is set.
Target resolves to a blocked private IP: verify DNS with nslookup <host>. Enable Allow private/internal target only when you have explicit authorization for that internal system.
